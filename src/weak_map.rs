/// key in a WeakMap does not prevent the object from being garbage collected.
/// Once an object used as a key has been collected, its corresponding values in 
/// any WeakMap become candidates for garbage collection as well â€” as long as they aren't strongly referred to elsewhere.
/// 
/// WeakMap allows associating data to objects in a way that doesn't prevent the key objects from being collected,
/// even if the values reference the keys. However, a WeakMap doesn't allow observing the liveness of its keys, 
/// which is why it doesn't allow enumeration; if a WeakMap exposed any method to obtain a list of its keys, 
/// the list would depend on the state of garbage collection, introducing non-determinism.
